Amazon S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function
By using event triggers in Amazon S3, you make the process of executing the Lambda functions automatic.

1. Create S3 on which the operations are performed
2. Create Lambda function
 2 a. Use a trigger
      Under S3 trigger, choose the S3 bucket that you created previously.
      When you configure an S3 trigger using the Lambda console,
      the console modifies your function's resource-based policy to allow Amazon S3 to invoke the function.

3. The Lambda function retrieves the source S3 bucket name and the key name of the uploaded object from the event parameter that it receives.
   The function uses the Amazon S3 getObject API to retrieve the content type of the object.

Note- configure the trigger to only apply to a prefix used for incoming objects.
